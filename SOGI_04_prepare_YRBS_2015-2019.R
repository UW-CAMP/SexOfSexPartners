# YRBS data preparation script

# !!! Before running this script, please review this repository's ReadMe file to ensure that "Step 1: Prepare Data Sets" is complete.

# This script takes YRBS data sets (2015:2019), which must have been previously obtained and prepared for use in the R environment, 
# and prepares them data for mergine with YRBS 2021 data/

### Prepare workspace ----- 
# clear environment
rm(list = ls())

# * call in packages ----
source("SOGI_00_packages.R")

# * define functions -----
tableNA <- function(x, ...){
   table(x, useNA = "ifany", ...)  
}
# the `tableNA` function tabulates data as the `table` function, but includes "NA"s by default.

# * call in data ------------
# Note: before calling in data, ensure that the directory location is correct; you may need to change that used here.

# `yrbs_years` object
